# STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN

Structural design patterns are a subset of design patterns in software development that focus on the composition of classes or objects to form larger, more complex structures. They help in organizing and managing relationships between objects to achieve greater flexibility, reusability, and maintainability in a software system.

## Types of Structural Design Patterns:

### 1. Adapter Method Design Pattern
Adapter Method is a structural design pattern, it allows you to make two incompatible interfaces work together by creating a bridge between them.

### 2. Bridge Method Design Pattern
Bridge Method is a structural design pattern,it provide to design separate an object's abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

### 3. Composite Method Design Pattern
Composite Method is structural design pattern, it's used to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern treats both individual objects and compositions of objects it allow clients to work with complex structures of objects as if they were individual objects.

### 4. Decorator Method Design Pattern
Decorator Method is structural design pattern, it allows to add behavior to individual objects, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

### 5. Facade Method Design Pattern
Facade Method is a structural design pattern, it provides a simplified, higher-level interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, making it easier for clients to interact with that subsystem.

### 6. Proxy Method Design Pattern
Proxy Method is a structural design pattern, it provide to create a substitute for an object, which can act as an intermediary or control access to the real object.

### 7. Flyweight Method Design Pattern
Flyweight Method is a structural design pattern, it is used when we need to create a lot of objects of a class. Since every object consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects.
