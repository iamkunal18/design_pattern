# BEHAVIOURAL DESIGN PATTERN

Behavioral design patterns are a subsetof design patterns in software development that deal with the communication and interaction between objects and classes. They focus on how objects and classes collaborate and communicate to accomplish tasks and responsibilities.

## Types of Behavioral Design Patterns:

1. ### Command Method Design Pattern
Command Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it promotes loose coupling between the sender (client) and the receiver (the object that performs the operation) and provides a way to support undoable operations.

2. ### Iterator Method Design Pattern
Iterator Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object (a collection) sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of that collection.

3. ### Mediator Method Design Pattern
Mediator Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it promotes loose coupling between objects by centralizing their communication through a mediator object. Instead of objects directly communicating with each other, they communicate through the mediator, which encapsulates the interaction and coordination logic.

4. ### Memento Method Design Pattern
Momento Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it provide to save and restore the previous state of an object without revealing the details of its implementation.

5. ### Observer Method Design Pattern
Observer Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically.

6. ### State Method Design Pattern
State Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

7. ### Strategy Method Design Pattern
Strategy Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable and it allows a client to choose an appropriate algorithm from a family of algorithms at runtime.

8. ### Template Method Design Pattern
Template Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method but lets subclasses alter some steps of that algorithm without changing its structure.

9. ### Visitor Method Design Pattern
Visitor Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it is used when you have a set of structured, hierarchical objects and you want to perform various operations on these objects without modifying their classes.

10. ### Null Object Method Design Pattern
Null Object Method is a Behavioral Design Pattern, it is used to handle the absence of a valid object by providing an object that does nothing or provides default behavior.
